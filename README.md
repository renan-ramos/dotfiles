# Dotfiles
My macos dotfiles. It uses stow, so clone it in your $HOME dir, and be sure that the folder is the same as it should be.

## Configuring

On the terminal run setup.sh file. And will prompt you for a instalation environment (work/personal). Keep in mind that personal instalations has everything that work config does.

> setup.sh
